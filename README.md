# CodeRage-
Code Rage! is a cross-platform multiplayer coding puzzle game where players work to complete simple coding prompts. The game incorporates an interesting mechanic where programs are broken into blocks of code (called CodeBlocks) that must be bought, then dragged and dropped into the correct order to create a working solution. Players must buy and arrange CodeBlocks in the correct order in a timely manner using minimal money in order to win.   Code Rage! consists of two gameplay modes: one-player and two-player. Two-player mode adds an additional competitive factor where both players must compete for CodeBlocks in order to finish the coding puzzle before the other. “Attack blocks” can also be bought in this mode that hinders the opposing player from finishing their prompt. This application works to incorporate both entertainment and education as it pertains to basic coding.
